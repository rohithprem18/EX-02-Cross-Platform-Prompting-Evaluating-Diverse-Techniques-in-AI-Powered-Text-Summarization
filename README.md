# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Algorithm
Define the Use Case: Select a specific task for evaluation across platforms (e.g., summarizing a document, answering a technical questiogenerating a creative story / Code). Ensure the use case is applicable to all platforms and will allow for comparison across response quaaccuracy, and depth. Create a Set of Prompts: Prepare a uniform set of prompts that align with the chosen use case. Each prompt shoulclear and precise, ensuring that all platforms are evaluated using the same input. Consider multiple prompts to capture the versatility oplatform in handling different aspects of the use case. Run the Experiment on Each AI Platform: Input the prompts into each AI tool (ChClaude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) and gather the responses. Ensure the same conditions are applied for each platform, such aformat, time to respond, and prompt delivery. Record response times, ease of interaction with the platform, and any technical issuesencountered. Evaluate Response Quality: Assess each platformâ€™s responses using the following criteria: Accuracy,Clarity,Depth,RelevanceCompare Performance: Compare the collected data to identify differences in performance across platforms. Identify any platform-speciadvantages, such as faster response times, more accurate answers, or more intuitive interfaces. Deliverables: A comparison table outliniperformance of each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) based on accuracy, clarity, depth, and relevance ofresponses. A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for use cases based on performance and user
